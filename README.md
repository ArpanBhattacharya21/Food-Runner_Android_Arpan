This is a demo app, so definitely neither you can place an actual order, nor any kind of payment will be made.
Thanks to Internshala Trainings, under whom this app is developed.

Standard Details:
1. The app will run on all device running on Android (4.3) Kit Kat or higher versions.
2. Internal memory space needed approx 10MB.
3. Internet Connectivity mandatory.

How to use:
1. Use the apk file provided in drive to install the app in your android phone.
2. You will have to register first in the appm using a running contact number (pseudo phone number will lead to invalid input error), emailId (can be pseudo as it is demo app, but domain.com is must example yahoo.co.in, yahoo.com, google.com etc)
3. After registering you can everytime use the app as usual without login untill you logout.
4. In the Drawer Menu from left you can see profile, orders made, logout, favourites etc.
